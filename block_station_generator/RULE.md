# Block/Station Generator – Cursor Agent Instructions

## Unit Test Requirement

**Whenever states, inputs, or outputs are created or modified in this dashboard, a unit test (pytest) MUST be created or updated.**

- Use **pytest** for tests.
- Place tests in `block_station_generator/tests/`.
- Each new state, input, or output must have at least one test case.
- This enables autotesting of every change and reduces regressions.

See `.cursor/rules/block-station-generator-unit-tests.mdc` for the full rule and examples.
